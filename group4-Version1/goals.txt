Project Name: Generative Flows with Invertible Attentions (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03959)


In this project, our aim is to reproduce the Table3 qualitative results and Figure4 quantitive results on CIFAR10 dataset.
In mentioned table(Table3), evaluation of sample quality on CIFAR10 dataset with several metrics are given. We are planning to reproduce the FID metric results with AttnFlow methods(Last 4 rows).
In mentioned figure(Figure4), comparison of samples from the AttnFlow methods and state-of-the-art models are given on CIFAR10 dataset.

---- version 1 submission ----
We have implemented Map based attention according to paper, and trained MARSCF architecture with IMAP layers,
- We couldn't trained our model enough due to time constraints, so our results aren't 
as good as we aimed. Our models generate noisy outputs for now, we couldn't computed quantitiative results yet.
- We still aim to accomplish our stated goals for v2 submission.
